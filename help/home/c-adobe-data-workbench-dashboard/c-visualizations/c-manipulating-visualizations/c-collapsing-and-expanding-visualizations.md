# Collapsing and Expanding Visualizations{#collapsing-and-expanding-visualizations}

Collapses/expands the current visualization.

Visualizations can be collapsed and expanded at any time. Collapsing a visualization will reduce the height of the visualization to just the title and tools portion, hiding the visualization body. Expanding a collapsed visualization will restore its size to its original height.

Collapsing a visualization is particularly useful for preserving a large number of visualizations within a dashboard while taking up minimal space. Users can expand a collapsed visualization to see its contents only when necessary.
