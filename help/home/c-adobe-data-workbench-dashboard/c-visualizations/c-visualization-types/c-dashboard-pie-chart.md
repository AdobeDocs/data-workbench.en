# Pie Chart{#pie-chart}

Pie chart visualizations allow you to display relative percentages of the metric values for a limited number of dimensions. A pie chart allows up to 20 unique data elements to be displayed on the chart at once. Each wedge of the pie represents a dimension in the dataset, along with its percentage. Each percentage is calculated relative to the metric values of the other dimensions displayed on the pie chart, which may not necessarily be the entire dataset.

Selections can be made in pie charts by clicking any particular wedge.
