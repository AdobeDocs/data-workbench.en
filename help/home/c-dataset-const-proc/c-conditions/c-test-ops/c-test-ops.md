# Test Operations{#test-operations}

Test operations take input from the available log fields, perform a test based upon their values, and return true if the test succeeded or false if the test failed.

 These tests are always the child of one of the [!DNL Boolean] operations described in the next section. See [Boolean Operations](../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-conditions/c-test-ops/c-boolean-ops.md#concept-9bee5fb907bb4e37871096aaf48b1baf).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the input is a vector of strings, only the first value (string) in the vector is used for the test. This rule applies to all of the test operations.
