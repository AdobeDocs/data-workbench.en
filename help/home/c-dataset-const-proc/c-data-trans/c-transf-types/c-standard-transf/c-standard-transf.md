# Standard Transformations{#standard-transformations}

A standard transformation takes a set of inputs, performs some operation, then provides that result in one or more output fields.

 The following sections provide a description, a table of available parameters, and an example for each of the standard transformations. Every data workbench server DPU provides all of the standard transformations.
