# File Server Unit Requirements{#file-server-unit-requirements}

The server's File Serving Unit (FSU) is the main data storage and management component of Data Workbench.

 The FSU acts as a file server for raw source data to the DPU, and, when appropriate, coordinates the clustering of DPUs. Each FSU is licensed to supply source data to up to five (5) DPUs.
