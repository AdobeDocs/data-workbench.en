# Sensor Requirements{#sensor-requirements}

Data Workbench Sensor collects event data from web, application, and data collection servers to be transmitted to any server.

 [!DNL Sensorâ€™s] instrumentation ensures consistently accurate measurement of events that occur in your Internet channel. [!DNL Sensor] supports many combinations of Web server software and operating system.

## Sensor System Recommendations {#section-0a981c3a47b644c1a1a56974ba033b9c}

The following table describes system recommendations for [!DNL Sensor]:
