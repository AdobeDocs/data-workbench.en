# Data Availability{#data-availability}

It is a normal and required practice for a server DPU to process and re-process data into new or refreshed dataset.

This may occur because of configuration changes, data source changes, hardware changes, inappropriate configuration, hardware failure, software failure, power failure, and so forth. When such processing or re-processing occurs, all dataset and system data is required to be immediately available to the DPU and FSU components. Failure to adhere to this requirement can lead to significant and unnecessary system down time.
