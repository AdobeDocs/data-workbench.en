# Annotations{#annotations}

Annotations are windows that users can add to a workspace to contain descriptive comments, graphics, or dynamic titles.

 Annotations also can be added to workspaces as callouts. For information about working with annotation callouts, see [Adding Callouts to a Workspace](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-vis/c-call-wkspc.md#concept-212b09e763044d938987b4a9c658adc0).
