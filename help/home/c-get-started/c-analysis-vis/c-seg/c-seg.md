# Segments{#segments}

Segments enable you to build dimensions on-the-fly from your selections.

 Segments are most useful when working with disjointed, non-overlapping groups that you want to use as a dimension, such as when comparing two types of shoppers based on their previous purchases.

Using a segment affects only the workspace in which you are using the segment dimension.
