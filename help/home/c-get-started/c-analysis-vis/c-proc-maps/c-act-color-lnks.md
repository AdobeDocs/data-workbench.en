# Activate a color link{#activate-a-color-link}

You can display the paths between nodes in a process map in color.

 The color scheme depends upon the color legend that is open in the workspace. See [Color Legends](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-analysis-vis/c-legends/c-color-leg.md#concept-f84d51dc0d6547f981d0642fc2d01358).

Right-click any node in the map and click **[!UICONTROL Options]** > **[!UICONTROL Color Links]**.

An X to the left of Color Links indicates that colored links are active in the map. When Color Links is disabled, arrows between nodes appear gray.
