# Save a dimension from a process map{#save-a-dimension-from-a-process-map}

Steps to save a dimension from a process map.

1. Right-click the selected nodes and click **[!UICONTROL Save Dimension]**. The [!DNL Save Dimension As] window appears. The default save location is the User\*profile name*\Dimensions folder.

   To create a new dimension based on multiple nodes, Ctrl+click and drag to create a box around the items that you want to select. Right-click the box and click **[!UICONTROL Collapse to a single node]**. Right-click the collapsed node and click **[!UICONTROL Save Dimension]**. 

1. In the [!DNL File name] field, type a more descriptive name for the dimension and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. You now have access to this dimension from any dimension list.

   If you would like all users of a profile to use the dimensions that you save, you must upload them to the appropriate profile using the [!DNL Profile Manager].
