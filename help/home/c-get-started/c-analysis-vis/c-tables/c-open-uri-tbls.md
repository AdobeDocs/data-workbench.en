# Open a URI from a table{#open-a-uri-from-a-table}

Open functionality is currently configured only in the Site application and only for opening URIs.

See [Configuring Open Functionality](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-intf-anlys-ftrs/c-config-open-funct.md#concept-854e6dc8bef34e6aa4ccfb7a8929af4d).

In [!DNL Site], from a URI table, you can right-click a URI to display a web page in a web browser. To view a URI in its native format (such as HTML), Data Workbench must have access to the referenced location and the application needed to open that item. For example, to view a web page, Data Workbench must have access to the Internet as well as have a web browser installed.

* Right-click an element of the dimension and click **[!UICONTROL Open URI]**.
