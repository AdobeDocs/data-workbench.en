# Open administrative interfaces{#open-administrative-interfaces}

Because your implementation of Data Workbench can be fully customized and, therefore, may differ from what is documented in this guide, exact paths to each visualization are not provided in this guide.

All of the administrative interfaces can be opened using either or both of the following options:

* **[!DNL Admin menu]:** Right-click within a workspace, click **[!UICONTROL Admin]**, then click the appropriate menu option. 

* **[!DNL Admin] tab:** Click to open the appropriate workspace thumbnail on the [!DNL Admin] tab.

For information about administering the servers on which Adobe software applications are installed, see the *Server Products Installation and Administration Guide*.
