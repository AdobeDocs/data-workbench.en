# Profile Manager{#profile-manager}

The Profile Manager is the main management tool in Data Workbench.

 It enables you to do the following:

* Edit configuration files (except for [!DNL report.cfg] files) and other types of files. 
* Publish local changes to a profile on the Insight Server. 
* Create new folders. 
* Edit your menu structure. See [Customizing Menus](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-intf-anlys-ftrs/c-ctm-menus/c-ctm-menus.md#concept-93d4c09cb7f34cd293b7b64fba1cf894). 
* Delete workspaces, templates, reports, and so on from Insight Server. 
* Manage metrics and dimensions.

For an overview of profiles, see [Working with Profiles](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-work-prof.md#concept-57ff43db95a34e83a39f819c7e6e42e1).
