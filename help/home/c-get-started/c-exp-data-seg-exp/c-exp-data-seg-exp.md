# Exporting data using segment export{#exporting-data-using-segment-export}

The segment export feature enables you to create a segment of the elements of any countable dimension, then output data for that segment on a batch or ongoing real-time basis into a tab-delimited file.

 Each time that you export a segment, you output metric or dimension data for all of the dimension elements included in that segment. You can control how the output data is formatted so that other systems can easily load the data. For information about configuring a segment for export, see [Configuring Segments for Export](../../../home/c-get-started/c-exp-data-seg-exp/t-config-sgts-expt.md#task-8857f221fa66463990ec9b60db6db372).
