# Report Set Requirements{#report-set-requirements}

Conceptual information about requirements for your report sets.

All report sets must:

* Be stored in a subfolder within the *<working profile name*>\Reports folder. They must appear on the [!DNL Reports] tab of the [!DNL Worktop]. 

* Contain a [!DNL Report.cfg] file in the report set folder. 
* Contain (or point to) at least one workspace.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To be viewed using [!DNL Report Portal], reports must follow specific naming conventions. Additionally, the directory into which reports are saved must follow a prescribed structure. For a description of these requirements, see [Ensuring that Your Report Sets are Compatible with Report Portal...](../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-install-rpt-port/c-rpt-port-user-inter.md#section-2b141e5d198a4bbea455699126c24706).
