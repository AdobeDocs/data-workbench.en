# Email Notification of Completed Report{#email-notification-of-completed-report}

You can configure data workbench to send an email when a report is generated.

Setting this value to True does not send out the report, but rather sends an email notifying the subscribed user that the report has been generated. 

1. From the [!DNL Reports] menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Monthly]** tab.
1. Open the [!DNL report.cfg] file.
1. In the [!DNL Notification Only] field, enter true to send an email when the report is complete.
