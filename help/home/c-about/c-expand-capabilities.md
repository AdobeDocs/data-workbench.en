# Expanding Metrics, Dimensions, and Filters{#expanding-metrics-dimensions-and-filters}

Data workbench enables you to create new metrics, filters, and dimensions to expand the information available through an application or to easily customize the definitions in the application to meet your needs. The open-ended nature of metrics, dimensions, and filters enables you to answer more questions as you add new metrics and dimensions.

Newly defined metrics can be evaluated over existing dimensions, and, similarly, existing metrics can be evaluated over newly defined dimensions. Newly defined metrics also can be used as input in other metrics. Because metrics are built on the client side (that is, their construction does not require dataset processing), they have a minimal impact on system performance. You can increase your analysis capabilities by constructing many levels of metrics.

For more information about the syntax used to manipulate metrics, dimensions, and filters, see [language syntax](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/client/c_qry_lang_syntx.html).
