# Hide Fallout Labels in Funnel{#hide-fallout-labels-in-funnel}

Toggle to open fallout labels in a Funnel visualization.

The Funnel visualization identifies where a customer abandons a marketing campaign or diverts from a defined conversion path while interacting with your website or cross-channel campaign. The left side of the Funnel visualization displays the results of a visit or visitors, while the right side displays the "Fallout" of those who abandon a specified path.

When in a **[!UICONTROL Funnel]** visualization, you can right-click the title and select **[!UICONTROL Hide Fallout]** from the menu to hide the fallout labels.
