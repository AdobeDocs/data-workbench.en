# Sorting Table Columns{#sorting-table-columns}

Sort table columns alphabetically or by ordinals.

To better select elements in a Dimension table, you can order the first column alphabetically or by ordinals by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Sort]** menu option.

The # character will display when a column is sorted by ordinals (the default).

**Select Sort Option**

To change sorting options between ordinal and alphabet, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Sort]**. Click the arrow to reverse the order.
