# Data Workbench 6.11 Update{#data-workbench-update}

Data Workbench 6.1.1 updates OpenSSL in your system necessary to fix the "Heartbleed" vulnerability found in previous versions of OpenSSL. Certain Data Workbench versions (5.5.x, 6.0.x and 6.1.x) used a version of OpenSSL deemed vulnerable.

Managed users of Data Workbench have been updated to version 6.1.1, but if you have an on-premise implementation you will need to update.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Because Data Workbench servers require authentication, it is important to understand that external attackers cannot exploit this vulnerability because they can't get past the initial handshake.
