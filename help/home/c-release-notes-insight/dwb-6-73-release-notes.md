## Known issue {#section-f2cb932f6225457a872fb916a78df89a}

* Data Workbench Workstation version 6.73 does not connect to Data Workbench Servers versions 6.61 and older. The reason is, older server versions use a weak form of ciphers not supported in version 6.73. To enable support for older versions

    1. Override default SSL Ciphers list on the server with a strong cipher list supported by OpenSSL version 1.0.1h. To override, add key ‘SSL Ciphers’ in the ‘Communications.cfg’ files available in ‘Components’ and ‘Components for Processing Servers’ directories. For example: `SSL Ciphers = string: !aNULL:AESGCM`     
    
       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >Ensure that the key is placed at the same level as the SSL Port. For details refer to [Communications Configuration Settings](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/svrprod/c_comm_cfg_stgs.html)

    1. Place the latest trust_ca_cert.pem file on the server 6.61 and older servers. This setting is applicable to all Workstation 6.7x versions.
