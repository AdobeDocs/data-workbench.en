# Pie Chart Update{#pie-chart-update}

Updates to the Pie Chart visualization lets you use default colors identified in a legend, or set colors based on the color chart.

When you open a pie chart, the colors for data sets are set by default with each identified in the legend.

The legend can be toggled on and off by right-clicking the chart and selecting **Show Legend**. The result is a pie chart without color codes and elements identified in callouts for each section.
