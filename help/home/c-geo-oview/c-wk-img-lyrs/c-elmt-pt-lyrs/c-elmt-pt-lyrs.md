# Working with Element Point Layers{#working-with-element-point-layers}

In data workbench, an element point layer displays one point on the globe for each element of a dimension.

 The size of the point displayed on the globe is determined by evaluating a specified metric over the dimension whose elements you want to plot. Therefore, larger metric values correspond to larger points on the globe.
