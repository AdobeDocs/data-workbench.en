# System Logs{#system-logs}

Error and audit logs can be found in the **[!UICONTROL Logs]** directory within the installation path. These logs are valuable for auditing the dashboard system and debugging any problems you may encounter. The logs are stored in files using the current date of the server:

Error logs: [!DNL thinclientweb-yyyy-mm-dd.log]

Audit logs: [!DNL thinclientweb-audit-yyyy-mm-dd.log]
